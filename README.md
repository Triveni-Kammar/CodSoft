## üïπÔ∏è 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python)
A fun and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe game** developed using Python.  
The player competes against the computer with programmed move logic.

**Features:**
- Classic 3x3 grid gameplay  
- Player vs Computer mode  
- Auto win/draw detection  
- Simple and clean HTML interface  
- Python handles game logic and responses  

**Tech Used:** Python, HTML

## üí¨ 2. Rule-Based Chatbot
A simple **rule-based chatbot** that gives predefined answers to user queries.  
It shows how basic chatbots can work without machine learning or external APIs.

**Features:**
- Rule-based text responses  
- Uses `if-else` and pattern logic in Python  
- Lightweight and easy to understand  
- User interface created with HTML only  

**Tech Used:** Python, HTML

## üñºÔ∏è 3. Image Captioning AI
An **image captioning system** that generates descriptive text for any uploaded image.  
It combines computer vision and natural language processing.

**Features:**
- Upload image via HTML form  
- Python processes the image and generates captions  
- Displays caption output directly on the web page  

**Tech Used:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask, HTML

## üìö Learning Outcomes
- Developed understanding of **Python logic and AI integration**  
- Built web interfaces using **HTML**  
- Implemented both **rule-based** and **AI-based** systems  
- Enhanced knowledge of **Flask** for simple web applications.
