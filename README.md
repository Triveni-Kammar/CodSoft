## 💬 2. Rule-Based Chatbot
A simple **rule-based chatbot** that gives predefined answers to user queries.  
It shows how basic chatbots can work without machine learning or external APIs.

**Features:**
- Rule-based text responses  
- Uses `if-else` and pattern logic in Python  
- Lightweight and easy to understand  
- User interface created with HTML only  

**Tech Used:** Python, HTML

## 🖼️ 3. Image Captioning AI
An **image captioning system** that generates descriptive text for any uploaded image.  
It combines computer vision and natural language processing.

**Features:**
- Upload image via HTML form  
- Python processes the image and generates captions  
- Displays caption output directly on the web page  

**Tech Used:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask, HTML
